Many of the existing machine learning models for health care analysis are concentrating on one disease per analysis. For example first is for Diabetes analysis, one for Heart analysis, one for Lung diseases like that. 
If a user wants to predict more than one disease, he/she has to go through different sites. There is no common system where one analysis can perform more than one disease prediction. 
Some of the models have lower accuracy which can seriously affect patientsâ€™ health. To make this work seamless and usable by the mass public, the test web application that makes predictions about various diseases using the concept of machine learning.
The multiple disease prediction is a powerful approach that holds the potential to revolutionize the way we detect, understand, and respond to events. 
 Our Proposed System aims at bridging gap between Doctors and Patients which will help both classes of users in achieving their goals.
The present approach of many systems focuses only on automating this process for single disease which lacks in building for multiple disease system.
Medical professionals, students, and patients can all benefit from prediction data so this will improve the importance of early prevention.
